<center><em>If you need to complete a contingent home sale, there are three main steps you&rsquo;ll need to take.</em></center>

<br>People always ask me what it takes to execute a contingent home sale. The good news is that this process—which involves selling your current home before buying your next—is simpler than you think. It only really requires three main steps:

**1\. Talk to your lender**. Over the course of this conversation, you and your lender should discuss what your current home could sell for, how much it will cost you to buy your next home, and what financing options would be most beneficial to your goals.

**2\. Talk to your agent**. While your lender should be able to give you a ballpark figure for what your home might sell for, your agent should be able to use a comparative market analysis to get a more precise idea of what your property’s list price should be. This figure will depend on how much homes in your area are selling for, how fast they’re selling, and other such factors. Your agent will also walk you through the steps you’ll need to take to make your home more appealing to buyers, as well as the fees and taxes you can expect to pay through the course of your home sale. These figures will be outlined in something called an “estimated proceeds sheet”, which will essentially detail your anticipated net proceeds when all is said and done.

**3\. Create a success plan**. Behind every successful home sale is a carefully thought out home-selling strategy; This is especially crucial for sellers who are also preparing to buy. Your agent should help you to not only market and sell your current home, but to find your next property at the same time. The goal is to create a seamless transition, which might include moving into a rental property for a short period of time, organizing a rent-back agreement, or perhaps using Compass’ Bridge Loan program. Through this awesome program, buyers can have two loans out at once. It also creates a situation in which the monthly payment on your new home is fronted for you for up to six months. This is definitely something to consider for those who qualify.
