If you want to sell for top dollar in this market, here are the four steps you need to take:

**1\. Schedule a pre-inspection.** If you call an inspector and have them do a full inspection of your home, they’ll usually generate a report with all their findings in 24 to 48 hours. These are the items you must review with your agent. Which priority items need to be repaired and which don’t? When you list your home, being able to share this report and show the buyer that your house is safe, sound, and in amazing shape will prompt them to pay you much more than they would for a home that needs work.&nbsp;

**2\. Decide whether to remodel or leave the house as is.** This is tricky because when you and your agent walk through your home and consider repainting, installing new cabinets, etc., you need to figure out which updates will give you the best return. You don’t want to spend $5,000 on upgrades and not get a penny back, right? Your agent should be able to advise you on which upgrades will add real value when you list your home.

**3\. Stage the property.** I know a few staging companies that would be happy to help with your staging consultation and/or provide the actual staging once your house is ready for it. If you stage the home properly, you’ll increase your return by 4% to 8%. There are different types of staging in today’s market. For example, virtual staging involves placing furniture digitally but not physically. Partial staging involves very light staging throughout the house. Full staging means bringing in beds, sofas, chairs, etc., before getting professional photos of the home done.&nbsp;

**4\. Do a final cleaning.** Remove all personal items, meaning something that might be important to you but no one else, and strip the home bare. Less is more when selling a home. After that, hire a professional cleaner to do a thorough cleaning. Everything should be spotless and in amazing shape. Finally, turn your attention to the landscaping. Applying a fresh coat of beauty bark and mowing the lawn before getting the home’s pictures taken and opening it up to showings will make it stand out from every other home on the market.&nbsp;
