<center><em>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I became a real estate agent.</em></center>

<br>Today I want to share the story of how real estate became my career and investing became my passion. My journey is a case study of why you don’t have to live paycheck to paycheck. My family experienced humble beginnings in the U.S. after immigrating from Vietnam when I was a child, but through hard work and determination, I was able to start my own business and buy my dream home. I’m ready to tell you how you can do the same.
