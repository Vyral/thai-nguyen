<br>Would you like to have money deposited into your bank account while you’re not even working? With the BRRRR (buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat) method, you can make it happen. Here’s a quick rundown of each step of this method:

**Buy:** When you buy a property, make sure the numbers fit your budget. Buying low is very important, and you need to know how much it’ll cost you to renovate the property. You also need to know what you’ll generate in rent and what your after-repair value will be.

**Rehab:** Finding the right rehab crew is important because they’re the ones helping you remodel the home. If you’re handy, that’s great because you’ll save tons of money. In any case, though, the rehab should fit your budget. Remember, you're renting the place, so get it rental ready.

**Rent:** I usually use Rentometer.com or Zillow Rent to help calculate what rents are going for in my area. If you hire a property manager, they’ll take a percentage of your rental income.

**Refinance:** Find the right lender to help you refinance and cash out.

**Repeat:** After you pull your money out, you repeat the process\!
